## Exercise
___
Write a method that accepts a number as an argument and returns a string containing that number along with its "ordinal indicator". E.g. passing in 1 would return "1st", 2 would return "2nd", 3 would return "3rd", 4 would return "4th", etc.

Make sure your method works for every number between 1 and 20.

If you're feeling ambitious, see if you can get it working for numbers beyond that.
